📝 Blog Project
A simple blog application built with Chakra UI for sleek UI components and Express.js as the backend server. Blog data is fetched from a local JSON file, making it easy to manage and extend content without a full database setup.

💡 This project was initially developed by following a guided tutorial from Net Ninja. The core blog functionality was later extended and enhanced independently to include a more dynamic UI and improved backend handling.
